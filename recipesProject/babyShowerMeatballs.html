                    Spaghetti is a classic dry Italian pasta with a long, solid, string-like shape. It forms the basis of many classic pasta dishes such as Spaghetti and Meatballs, spaghetti Bolognese, cacio e pepe and spaghetti aglio e olio. Itâ€™s also an excellent, inexpensive pantry staple to have on hand for a back pocket pasta dinner anytime. Its neutral profile lends itself to being tossed together with whatever you have on hand, like jarred sauces, leftover veggies or even just olive oil and a scattering of red pepper flakes. Spaghetti is easy to make, but there are some guidelines to follow to ensure consistently cooked and flavorful strands.
